# Vultr

Type: `vultr`

The `vultr` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Vultr](https://www.vultr.com). The builder takes a source image,
runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots
it into a reusable image. This reusable image can be then used as the
foundation of new servers that are launched within Vultr.

The builder does *not* manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

**NOTE**: Packer-Builder-Vultr [v2+](https://github.com/vultr/packer-builder-vultr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200-2020-11-23) uses [API V2](https://www.vultr.com/api/)

<!-- Builder Configuration Fields -->

### Optional

-   `os_id` (int) - The id of the os to use. This will be the OS that will be used to launch a new instance and provision it. See [List Operating Systems](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-os).

-   `snapshot_description` (string) - Description of the snapshot.

-   `snapshot_id` (string) -   If you've selected the 'snapshot' operating system, this should be the ID of the snapshot. See [Snapshot](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-snapshots).

-   `ssh_key_ids` (array of string) - List of SSH keys to apply to this server on install. Separate keys with commas. See [SSH Key](https://www.vultr.com/api/v2/#operation/list-ssh-keys).
